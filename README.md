# imm-compatibility-checker.ps1

This script is work-in-progress. Documentation to follow.

## To-do list

1. **Authentication**: How to get credentials from the user (console prompt or require user to be connected prior to running script?)
2. **Domains**: How to get the list of domains to check from the user, or will it just be a single UCS domain at a time?
3. **Progress Bar**: Need to clean this up so that it can comprehend more than a single config file being published.
4. **Error handling**: Bad/invalid config file, unable to connect to UCS.
